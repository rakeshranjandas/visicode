# visicode
A framework for visualising running of code.


# Motivation
Learning algorithms -> Create visualisations as notes


# Idea
Imagine a movie. It follows the sequence:
Create script -> Design set/props/visual elements -> Synchronise movements with proper timing


# Development Phases
1) Is the idea feasible: Use whatever knowledge I have and create a prototype. Write visualiser for Kadane's algorithm (using single scene/ inside a single method)
2) Further Improvements - JS framework choice (React??), Nested scenes (in popups), Variables listener (should log to script if listened variable changes)
